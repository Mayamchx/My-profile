		<h2> Art </h2>
		<p> 
			At an early age, I developed a keen interest in art. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Throughout high school, I dedicated three years to studying and exploring various artistic endeavors, both independently and collaboratively with classmates.
		</p>
		<p>
			This period marked a wonderful journey of self-discovery for me.
			<br>
			I learned to generate creative ideas and see projects through to completion. 
			<br>
			Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for philosophy and the French language, which, like art, hold significant meaning for me.
		</p>

	<div class="box-design">
		<h2> Business </h2>
		<p> 
			Reflecting on my background in art, many people wonder why I chose to attend the ESSEC Business School.
			<br>
			<br>
			Even though I have a genuine interest in art, I envision myself either managing teams in marketing or finance, or running my own business.
			<br>
			That's why I feel I am at the right place at the ESSEC Business School and love learning about statistics, marketing, and economics.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box-design">
		<h2> Self-development </h2>
		<p> 
			Since childhood, I have been pondering life's most profound questions. 
			<br>
			Throughout high school, I faced challenges balancing relationships and mental health issues.
			<br>
			It was during this time that I developed a keen interest in self-development and growth, seeking to improve my life and delving into psychology and spirituality.
			<br>
			<br>
			This journey has become a key factor in shaping my life.
